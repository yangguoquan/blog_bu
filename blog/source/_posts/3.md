There have been modifications to the `app.rb` file since your last commit.  Find out which line has changed.
```
```

```
* LEVEL 30

```
Name: blame

```
Name: branch
Level: 31
Difficulty: *

You want to work on a piece of code that has the potential to break things, create the branch test_code.
```
```
➜  git_hug git:(master) git branch test_code
➜  git_hug git:(master) git branch -a
* master
  test_code
```
* LEVEL 32

```
Name: checkout
Level: 32
Difficulty: **

Create and switch to a new branch called my_branch.  You will need to create a branch like you did in the previous level.
```
```
➜  git_hug git:(master) git checkout -b my_branch
Switched to a new branch 'my_branch'
```
* LEVEL 33

```
Name: checkout_tag
Level: 33
Difficulty: **

You need to fix a bug in the version 1.2 of your app. Checkout the tag `v1.2`.
```
```
➜  git_hug git:(master) git checkout v1.2
Note: checking out 'v1.2'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at 8dcbca8... Some more changes
➜  git_hug git:(8dcbca8) githug play
```
* LEVEL 34

```
Name: checkout_tag_over_branch
Level: 34
Difficulty: **

You need to fix a bug in the version 1.2 of your app. Checkout the tag `v1.2` (Note: There is also a branch named `v1.2`).

```
```
➜  git_hug git:(master) git checkout tags/v1.2
Note: checking out 'tags/v1.2'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at bf9a29f... Some more changes
➜  git_hug git:(bf9a29f) githug play
```
* LEVEL 35

```
Name: branch_at
Level: 35
Difficulty: ***

```
```
➜  git_hug git:(master) git branch test_branch HEAD^1
```

* LEVEL 36

```
Name: delete_branch
Level: 36
Difficulty: **

* LEVEL 38

```
Name: merge
Level: 38
Difficulty: **

We have a file in the branch 'feature'; Let's merge it to the master branch.
```

➜  git_hug git:(master) githug play
```
* LEVEL 40

其实不知道怎么翻译 `git rebase` 这个命令。大概意思是从某个提交分化出两个分支，然后其中一个分支需要将另一个分支的修改合并过来，但是又不想在提交记录上留下两个分支合并的痕迹，只留下一个分支以前后顺序记录两边的修改。

git rebase 一个分支的所有修改在另一个分支上重新应用一遍，所以在提交记录上看，会发现一个分支的所有提交在另一个分支之前或者之后。然后删除另一个被合并的分支，保持分支简洁。

git rebase master feature 表示将 feature 上的修改在 master 上重新应用一遍

```
Name: rebase
Level: 40
Difficulty: **

We are using a git rebase workflow and the feature branch is ready to go into master. Let's rebase the feature branch onto our master branch.
```
```
➜  git_hug git:(master) git log --graph --all
➜  git_hug git:(master) git rebase master feature
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: add feature
```

>在使用此命令的时候，需要非常注意的是，不要 rebase 哪些已经推送到公共库的更新，因为此操作是重新应用修改，所以公共库的更新可能已经被其他协作者所同步，如果再次 rebase 这些修改，将可能zh

* LEVEL 41
将版本库未打包的松散对象打包
```
Name: repack
Level: 41
Difficulty: **

Optimise how your repository is packaged ensuring that redundant packs are removed.
```
```
➜  git_hug git:(master) git repack
Counting objects: 3, done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
➜  git_hug git:(master) git repack -d
Nothing new to pack.
```
* LEVEL 42

```
Name: cherry-pick
Level: 42
Difficulty: ***

Your new feature isn't worth the time and you're going to delete it. But it has one commit that fills in `README` file, and you want this commit to be on the master as well.
```
```
➜  git_hug git:(master) git log --all
➜  git_hug git:(master) git log
➜  git_hug git:(master) git cherry-pick ca32a6dac7b6f97975edbe19a4296c2ee7682f68

 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 2 deletions(-)
➜  git_hug git:(master) githug play
```
* LEVEL 43

```
Name: grep
Level: 43
Difficulty: **

Your project's deadline approaches, you should evaluate how many TODOs are left in your code
```
```
➜  git_hug git:(master) git grep TODO
***************************
app.rb:# TODO Make site url variable.
app.rb:# TODO Make API version variable.
app.rb:# TODO Redirecting queries could be useful.
config.rb:    # TODO Move password to a configuration file.
```

* LEVEL 44

重命名提交。当涉及提交修改时，应该想到 git rebase -i 命令，它接受可以一个参数（提交的哈希值），它将罗列出此提交之后的所有提交，然后可以对个个提交做对应的操作。  

```
Name: rename_commit
Level: 44
Difficulty: ***

Correct the typo in the message of your first (non-root) commit.
```
```
